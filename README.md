## Aim of the project

The project provided the opportunity to dive into a small sized data set and carry out an EDA on my own for the first time. Data and a set of instructions were supplied by neuefische. The analysis was carried out by myself which included creating a presentation for a hypothetical client. 
The data is centered around the real estate market of King County and the hypothetical client is a buyer who is looking for a new home.
